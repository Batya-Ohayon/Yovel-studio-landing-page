# Yovel-studio-landing-page
When I started studying web development my friend asked me to think of an effective way to keep track of trainees who wanted to train with her (right when she opened a new studio) I decided to use what I learned, even though it was very basic knowledge, to help her.
I built a landing page that meets her needs with html and css.
